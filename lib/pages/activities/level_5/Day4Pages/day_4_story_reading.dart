Nick's parents had finally given him permission to get a puppy. Nick was so excited about it that he could hardly wait to bring his puppy home. The family had decided that they would adopt a shelter puppy, so one Saturday, Nick and his parents visited the shelter where Nick volunteered. When they arrived, Nick told the shelter manager why they were there.

"That's wonderful!" said the manager. "We have two litters of puppies that are waiting for good homes. One is a litter of dalmatians, and the other is a litter of corgis."

Nick and his parents looked at one another for a moment. Then, Nick said, "I'm pretty sure we don't have enough room in our home for a dalmatian. Could we look at the corgi puppies?"

"That sounds sensible," Mom said. "I like corgis, and I've heard that they're good family pets."

The manager escorted Nick and his parents to the room where the puppies lived. Within a moment, Nick had found the corgi puppy he wanted. "Look," he pointed. "That's the one I want!" Everyone looked at the puppy Nick had found. He was the smallest of the litter, but he looked healthy and friendly. The manager let Nick and his family cuddle the puppy and play with him for a few minutes. Then Nick said, "I'm absolutely sure about him, Mom and Dad."

Mom and Dad agreed that he was a good choice. Dad asked, "What's his name going to be?"

"How about Tucker? He looks like a Tucker, doesn't he?" Nick asked.

"Tucker it is," said the manager as she printed out the adoption papers. Mom and Dad signed the papers, and then the manager handed Nick and his parents a leash, a bag of food, and three dog toys. "Here are some important things you'll need," she said, handing Nick a list.

Nick looked at the list. They would need a kennel or crate, food and water dishes, and a lot more. "We'll have to go to the pet-supply store next," he told his parents.
